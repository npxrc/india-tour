The original city of Old Delhi used to serve as a walled city and political and financial centre of medieval India, the Delhi Sultanate, and the Mughal Empire. <u class=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Delhi\">In December of 1911, King George V of Great Britain declared that the capital of British India would move from Kolkata (Calcutta at the time) to Delhi.</u> However, the area making up present-day Delhi has been inhabited since the 6th century BCE. <br> In 1857, the British East India Company gained control of Delhi, and ruled the Indian subcontinent for 90 years until India gained independence in 1947. After India gained independence in 1947, New Delhi continued to grow and expand, with the creation of residential areas such as Lajpat Nagar, Chanakyapuri, and Hauz Khas.<br>Currently, Delhi is a thriving city, and is the second biggest city in India, and the fourth largest city in the world.",
