New Delhi, the capital of India, is home to several places of historical significance. Here are some notable ones:

The Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was the main residence of the Mughal emperors in Delhi. It was constructed in 1639 by Shah Jahan and served as the capital of the Mughals until 1857. The fort's impressive architecture, with its massive red sandstone walls and intricate marble decorations, is a testament to the grandeur of the Mughal era.[3]

The Purana Qila (Old Fort) is believed to be the site of the ancient city of Indraprastha, mentioned in the Mahabharata. The current fort was constructed by Sher Shah Suri in the 16th century and contains several monuments from different eras, including the Qila-i-Kuhna Mosque.[3]

The Delhi Red Fort, originally called the Qila-E-Mubarak and the Lal Qila, is the largest monument in Delhi. The construction of the fort occurred between 1639 and 1648 as the palace fort of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan's new capital, aptly named Shahjahanabad. Commissioned by Shah Jahan, the fort was made of red sandstone and white marble, and the exterior walls made of white limestone. [1] The fort's architecture is a blend of Islamic, Hindu, Persian, and Timurid styles, designed by architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori who also designed the Taj Mahal. [4] It covers an area of 255 acres and has a circumference of 2.5 km, with walls rising up to 33 meters high. [2] The fort complex houses several structures like the Diwan-i-Aam for public audiences, Diwan-i-Khas for private audiences, Rang Mahal for royal ladies, Mumtaz Mahal housing a museum, and the Moti Masjid. [1]

In 1739, the fort was invaded and plundered by Persian ruler Nadir Shah, who took away the famous Peacock Throne and other treasures. [3] After the 1857 revolt against the British, the fort's marble structures were demolished, but the defensive walls remained intact and were used as a garrison. [4] Since India's independence in 1947, the Prime Minister hoists the national flag and delivers a speech from the fort's ramparts every year on August 15th, a tradition started by Jawaharlal Nehru. [1][3] The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 for its architectural grandeur and historical significance. [1]

The Purana Qila (Old Fort) in Delhi holds immense historical significance as one of the oldest standing structures in the city. It is believed to be built on the site of the legendary city of Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas from the epic Mahabharata.[1][3] Archaeological excavations have unearthed artifacts dating back to the 3rd century BCE, indicating the presence of ancient settlements in the area.[5]

The fort was constructed by the Mughal Emperor Humayun in the 16th century as part of his new city of Dinpanah.[1][2] After Humayun's defeat by Sher Shah Suri in 1540, the fort was captured and renovated by Suri, who renamed it Shergarh.[2] It later served as a temporary refuge for Japanese civilians during World War II and for refugees during the Partition of India in 1947.[1][3]

The Purana Qila's alignment with the central vista of New Delhi, designed by Edwin Lutyens, symbolically connects the old fort to the modern imperial capital.[3] This deliberate alignment highlights the fort's enduring legacy and its role in shaping the city's urban landscape over centuries.

The fort's architectural features, including the massive walls, gates, and structures like the Sher Mandal and a mosque, bear testimony to the architectural styles and construction techniques of the Mughal and Afghan rulers.[1][4] These elements make the Purana Qila a significant historical and architectural landmark in Delhi.
