The Bangalore Palace is a magnificent edifice that holds immense historical significance as a symbol of the opulent lifestyle and grandeur of the Wadiyar dynasty, the erstwhile rulers of the Kingdom of Mysore. [1] Constructed in 1887 by King Chamaraja Wadiyar, the palace showcases a blend of Tudor and Scottish Gothic architectural styles, reflecting the influence of British colonial rule in India during that era. [1][2]

Located in the heart of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) in the Vasanth Nagar area, the palace stands as a testament to the city's rich cultural heritage and its multi-layered history. [1][2] It served as the residence of the Wadiyar kings and witnessed many important events and gatherings during their reign. [1]

Today, the Bangalore Palace is owned by the legal heirs of the Wadiyar dynasty and has been open to the public since 2005. [2] It attracts numerous tourists and history enthusiasts who come to marvel at its opulent interiors, intricate woodwork, and lavish furnishings that offer a glimpse into the royal lifestyle of the past. [1][4]

The palace grounds have also played a significant role in Bengaluru's contemporary cultural scene, hosting various music concerts, festivals, and events over the years, including performances by renowned international artists. [1][4] This blend of historical grandeur and modern cultural vibrancy makes the Bangalore Palace a unique and iconic landmark in the city.

Despite legal battles over its ownership in the past, the palace remains a cherished heritage site, meticulously preserved and maintained by its current custodians, ensuring that its rich history and architectural splendor are celebrated for generations to come. [2]

The ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) Temple was inaugurated by the 9th president of India, Shankar Dayal Sharma, on May 31, 1997.[1][2][3] It is one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world, located in Rajajinagar, Bangalore. The temple complex covers an area of 7 acres and was constructed over a period of 10 years from 1987 to 1997, involving 600 skilled craftsmen and using 32,000 cubic meters of stone, 131,250 tons of cement, and 1,900 tons of steel.[1]

The main deities in the temple are Sri Radha Krishna Chandra, along with other shrines dedicated to Sri Krishna Balarama, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Sri Prahlada Narasimha, and Sri Srinivasa Govinda.[3] The temple features a 17-meter-high gold-plated dhwaja-stambha (flag post) and an 8.5-meter-high gold-plated kalash shikhara (crown). It is known for its fusion of traditional and modern architectural styles, blending granite, marble, and Korean glass.[3]

ISKCON Bangalore celebrates major Hindu festivals like Janmashtami, Radhashtami, and Gaura Purnima, as well as organizes various spiritual and educational programs.[2] The temple also runs the Akshaya Patra Foundation, which provides free mid-day meals to over 1.6 million students across India, a program praised by former US President Barack Obama.[2]
